Introduction to Zentropy

Zentropy is a modification of the totally awesome Basic theme.  It is the ultimate Drupal 6 starer theme.

Here is what we changed:

- Removed SASS stuff (never used)
- Removed theme settings (not as practical as might seem)
- Added Yaoo YUI Reset + Base CSS
- Reorganized CSS files
- Added base Javascript files
- Tweaked preprocess_page and some other theme functions
- .htaccess tweaks file for manual inclusion
- Included a bunch of external js files (see warning below)

-- IMPORTANT --

We included some external javascript libraries that we use frequently that may or may not be compatible
with the Drupal license. They are all open-source and we use them in our projects but if this ever goes on
Drupal.org they will be removed.
