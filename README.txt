DISCLAIMER

I included some external javascript libraries that we use frequently at Drop Themes/Webdrop that may or may not be compatible with the Drupal license. They are all open-source and we use them in a bunch of our projects.

However, due to Drupal's particularities if this version of the theme ever goes up on Drupal.org they will be removed.
That said, since this is mostly a person project don't hold your breath for that to happen!
