HELP

For feature-requests and help please access the project page on github: https://github.com/alexweber/drupal_zentropy

This project will live on github for the forseeable future because we like bundling 3rd party open-source projects.

DISCLAIMER

We included some external javascript libraries that we use frequently which may or may not be compatible with the Drupal license.
They are all open-source and we like having them around!

However, due to Drupal's particularities if this version of the theme ever goes up on Drupal.org they will be removed.
That said, since this is mostly a company project don't hold your breath...
