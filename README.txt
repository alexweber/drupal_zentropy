DISCLAIMER

We included some external javascript libraries that we frequently at Webdrop that may or may not be compatible with the Drupal license. They are all open-source and we like having them around!

However, due to Drupal's particularities if this version of the theme ever goes up on Drupal.org they will be removed.
That said, since this is mostly a person project don't hold your breath for that to happen...
